# Artificial Intelligence Technique 
# Particle swarm optimization  PSO

This is a demonstration of AI Technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO), used for feature selection.

## Goals:
- Implement a PSO algorithm to select the most impactful features in a dataset.
- Show the results of the feature selection and compare results without any feature
selection.

The dataset used contains 8481 rows and 57 columns. 

## Note:
- This assignment is done only using NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn.
- No column manually dropped during preprocessing, as columns are to be selected randomly in PSO
- No Deep learning algorithm are used.


Note: The code for PSO is an attempted assignment. Only for academic purposes.
