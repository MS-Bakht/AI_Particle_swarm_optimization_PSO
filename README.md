Apply PSO for feature selection

## Goals:
- Implement a PSO algorithm to select the most impactful features in a dataset.
- Show the results of the feature selection and compare results without any feature
selection.

Using dataset used in Genetic Algorithm 

## Note:
- You are not allowed to use any library other than NumPy, Pandas and
Scikit-learn.
- You cannot drop any column manually in preprocessing
- No Deep learning algorithm
- Plagiarism and collusion are taken extremely seriously.

Note: The code for PSO is made by alterations in the code of Genetic algorithm (uploaded earlier)
